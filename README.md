# TBI-Prevalence-Canada

This repository contains all files for the manipulation and analysis related to the manuscript Tuberculosis Infection Prevalence Among Foreign-Born Canadian Residents: A Modelling Study. The Census folder contains all files and scripts related to data cleaning and manipulation, the Analysis and Output folder contains all scripts used for analysis and all output files.

Each census year has its own set of scripts for data manipulation and estimation of TBI prevalence. However, all them share the same RMD for analysis. The provincial level datasets share the data manipulation and analysis scripts so each provincial dataset can be inserted into one set of scripts depending on what output is desired.
